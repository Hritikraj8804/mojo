# Welcome to Mojo ðŸ”¥

Mojo is a new programming language that bridges the gap between research 
and production by combining Python syntax and ecosystem with systems 
programming and metaprogramming features. Mojo is still young, but it is designed
to become a superset of Python over time.  

We plan to open-source Mojo progressively over time, but it's changing very quickly now. 
We believe that a small, tight-knit group of engineers with a shared vision can move 
faster than a community effort, so we will continue to incubate it within Modular until 
it's more complete.  Please see the [Mojo FAQ](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/faq.html)
for more information about this and other common questions. 

We've opened this repo now because we want to gather issues and engage in feedback 
from users who have access to the Mojo Playground (our hosted JupyterHub
where you can try coding with an early version of Mojo). 
To get access to the Mojo Playground, [see here to sign up](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/get-started.html).
Then, when you want to report issues or request features,
[please create a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/issues).

## INSTRUCTIONS-

- Fork this Repository using the button at the top on right corner.
- Clone your forked repository to your pc ( git clone "url from clone option.)
- Create a new branch for your modifications (ie. `git branch new-user` and check it out `git checkout new-user` or simply do `git checkout -b new-user`)
- Add your files (`git add -A`), commit (`git commit -m "added myself"`) and push (`git push origin new-user`)
- Create a pull request
- Star this repository

##  Wait for Pull Request to merge

##  Celebrate

```py
'''
Always make more then 4 pull requests.
Lets say you have made only 4 pull request to different projects,
but one project is excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted and 
then you have remaining 3 valid pull requests if these projects is not excluded.
If you fail to make 4 pull requests then you can't get digital-swags.
I will recommend you to make pull request to your own repo which is very very safest side for you..
keep in mind that repo has hacktoberfest topic..
